# Finite-Difference-Methods-in-Option-Pricing

The finite difference methods is a very advanced topic in option pricing area and it is also a field that I have been working on. 

In this project, I compiled all the needed files from MC simulation files and wrote the test file to test the FDM scheme using different values in option factors such as asset price S, strike price K, exercise data T, risk-free interest rate r, constant volatility sig and cost of carry b.
